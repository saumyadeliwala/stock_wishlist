# Watchlist App - Flutter
This is a simple Flutter app screen that shows a watchlist of stocks. It has multiple tabs, and you can see stock details like name, price, and change in percentage.

## My Approach
I wanted to build a clean, easy-to-use app for viewing stock watchlists. I started by:
- Breaking the app into small parts: one for the main screen, one for the stock list, and one for the tabs.
- Using tabs to let users switch between watchlists, keeping the layout simple.
- Showing price changes in green (up) or red (down) for quick understanding.
- Keeping the data static for now. I focused on making the app fast and simple, with room to add more features in the future.
